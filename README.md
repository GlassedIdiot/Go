A repo for the work I do in go. Mostly black hat releated.

## Stegnography Project

Welcome to the Stegnography project! This repository contains a Go-based application focused on steganography, specifically designed for injecting payloads into PNG files. The project is currently in its beta phase, meaning it's under active development and testing.**At the current time it is not ready for usage**.

## Overview

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. In this project, we explore the concept by embedding data within PNG files, leveraging the robustness and widespread use of the PNG format.
Current Status

As of now, the Stegnography project is in its beta phase. This means that while the core functionality is implemented, we are continuously working on improving the application's performance, stability, and feature set. We encourage users to try out the application but also to keep in mind that they might encounter bugs or limitations.
Bug Fixes and Contributions

I will try to fix some bugs and issues that I am facing. As of now this is not viable for usage.
